## About the Collection

Friends of the Plum Blossom is a digital library of photographs of myself and my loved ones. The collection is comprised of an assortment of my favorite pictures and videos that Iâ€™ve collected throughout my life.  The collection will consist mostly of photographs and may include a few videos in the future. Objects in the collection span from the late 1980s to present time. I anticipate potentially adding to the collection as a method of sharing my favorite pictures and videos with my friends and family.
