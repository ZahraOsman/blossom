## About the Collection

Friends of the Plum Blossom is a digital library of photographs of myself and my loved ones. The collection is comprised of an assortment of my favorite pictures and videos that Iâ€™ve collected throughout my life.  The collection will consist mostly of photographs and may include a few videos. The inclusion of video formats will be limited due to overall 1GB size limitation of the collection.  Objects in the collection span from the late 1980s to present time. I anticipate potentially adding to the collection as a method of sharing my favorite pictures and videos with my friends and family. 

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
